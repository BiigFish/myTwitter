So I'm wiping the slate clean and starting again, this time with the intent of having the posts be longer and more focused on a topic. Daily consistently is probably beyond my reach but that would be cool.</p><p>Topics will most likely be pretty random and of very little interest to most. My brain mostly thinks of coding websites, my gaming addition, writing fiction but never writing, and anxiety. I feel a great passion for these topics and I hopefully that can translate to little posts that are interesting enough for me to reread.</p><p>This is a purely selfish activity of refreshing my brains thoughts into words. I suppose you could call it a therapy session.</p><p>Happy Thanksgiving.</p>"
